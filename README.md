# Ai Agent with Google ADK(Agent Development Kit)

## Simple Welcome Agent


## Agent with Facts(Tool Function)
Agents can also access tool function to answer questions from a given set of Q&A(an FAQ style input) instead of general answers which it can provide.
For that we can use the in built Tool Function from Google ADK. 
We need to create the tool(the list of FAQ) by passing the the list to the tool function. 
Then use that tool to the Agent to answer queries from that list.
